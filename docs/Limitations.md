| **Appliance Localization**   | For the Japanese locale of   OpenManage Enterprise, the date format displayed is in US 'short' date format   instead of the Japanese format.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Appliance Upgrade**        | In a pure IPv6 network (without   IPv4), the availability of any new upgrade version from dell.com, using   online method, is not displayed on the Console and Plugins page.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Appliance Upgrade**       | After installing or upgrading to   OpenManage Enterprise version 3.3.1 on Hyper-V, power off the appliance,   remove the standard network adapter and add a legacy network adapter, and   then power on the appliance.                                                                                                         |
| **Configuration Management** | When the internal share uses   HTTPS, then, template creation, template deployment, Boot to Network ISO, and   firmware updation are not supported on FX2, VRTX, and M1000e chassis.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Configuration Management** | When the internal share uses   HTTPS, then, template creation and deployment, and firmware updates are not   supported on the CCD-discovered MX7000 sleds.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Configuration Management** | Firmware catalog management   using Dell.com or a local network path is limited to only the Enterprise   Server catalog. Other catalogs such as ESXi_Catalog.xml.gz are not supported.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Configuration Management** | RAID secure attributes are not   supported on target devices during template or profile deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Configuration Management** | The appliance fails to identify   locally shared folders if the folder names have spaces in them. For example,   the appliance fails to retrieve files from an offline NFS source folder named   D____K (with 4 spaces between 'D' and 'K'). This happens as the appliance   ignores the spaces and interprets the name as DK. |
| **Device Discovery**         | Only OpenSSH is supported for   the discovery and inventory collection of Windowsbased servers and Hyper-Vs.   Other SSH protocol implementations, like Cygwin SSH, are not supported.                                                                                                                                         |
| **General**                  | Filtering does not work as   expected when the following special characters are used in the naming of   groups, alert policies, profiles, templates, and other instances: ,, \, _, %,   #, ', +, ), and &. The permissible special characters are : /, ?, ., >,   <, ", :, ;, \|, ], }, {, [, -, =, ~, `, (, ^, *, $, @, !.    |
| **Inventory**                | For the discovered Hyper-V servers, the Populated DIMM Slots   and the Total DIMM Slots fields are displayed as '0' on the device's Overview   page.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Reports**                  | The naming of reports only allows the following special   characters: '_' and '-'. A report's name cannot have special characters such   as ,, \, %, #, ', +, ), and &. For example, a report with the name   "OME3. @NIC^Report" is not allowed.                                                                              |
| **Reports**                  | Export of large firmware compliance reports, containing more than 200,000   elements, fails and the appliance displays the Application timeout error.                                                                                                                                                                           |
