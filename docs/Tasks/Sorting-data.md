# Sorting data
The console software provides sorting options on certain URIs that return a collection of entities. The sorting options enable the clients to get sorted results using the `Sort` operators on certain attributes of the model entity behind the collection. 

> The relevant URI sections contain information about the attributes that support sorting.
